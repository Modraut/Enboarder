# Questions

#### Question 1

Implement ‘Array.reduce()’ in your own way.

#### Question 2

Implement Lodash’s ‘groupBy’ in your own way

#### Question 3

You have a large bunch of HTML. Inside that HTML are p tags, li tags, table tags, really any and all kinds of HTML tags. Most importantly there are anchor/link tags.

Write a program to find all of the URLs to which those link tags link and verify that the URLs return a 200 response. In a given chunk of this HTML, we could have anywhere from 0 to 100+ links, so your solution should handle the case where there are plenty of links.
**Requirements:**

-   First, you'll want to figure out a way to extract all of the URLs.
-   Second, you'll want to test the URLs and report back to the user which are valid and which are not.
-   Third, you'll want to make it really fast by checking the URLs concurrently or by parallelising the checks. You might want to think about caching as well.

#### Question 5

Simple react component to implement expandable <textarea />. Very similar to this. Just basic requirements - not everything that material-ui does. Simple auto expand/contract feature.
[https://mui.com/components/textarea-autosize/](https://mui.com/components/textarea-autosize/)

Extend the package.json file to include your dependencies required. We expect it to be kept minimum - just required to render a React component, if you are answering question 5.
