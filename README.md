## Questions

#### Question 1

Implement `Array.reduce()` or `Array.map()` in your own way.

#### Question 2

Implement Lodashâ€™s `groupBy` in your own way

#### Question 3

You have a large bunch of HTML. Inside that HTML are p tags, li tags, table tags, really any and all kinds of HTML tags. Most importantly there are anchor/link tags.

Write a program to find all of the URLs to which those link tags link and verify that the URLs return a 200 response. In a given chunk of this HTML, we could have anywhere from 0 to 100+ links, so your solution should handle the case where there are plenty of links.

**Requirements:**

-   First, you'll want to figure out a way to extract all of the URLs.

-   Second, you'll want to test the URLs and report back to the user which are valid and which are not.

-   Third, you'll want to make it really fast by checking the URLs concurrently or by parallelising the checks. You might want to think about caching as well.

#### Question 4

CSS test: Apply required CSS to produce the HTML as per the result image provided.

In [answer04](https://github.com/enboarder/tech-test-junior-fullstack-engineer/tree/master/answers/answer04) folder, open this [index.html](https://github.com/enboarder/tech-test-junior-fullstack-engineer/blob/master/answers/answer04/index.html) file in a browser. Apply required css in the [styles.css](https://github.com/enboarder/tech-test-junior-fullstack-engineer/blob/master/answers/answer04/styles.css) file. The end result should look like the image in [CSS_Result.png](https://github.com/enboarder/tech-test-junior-fullstack-engineer/blob/master/answers/answer04/CSS_Result.png) file.

#### Question 5

Simple react component to implement expandable <textarea  />. Very similar to this. Just basic requirements - not everything that material-ui does. Simple auto expand/contract feature.

[https://mui.com/components/textarea-autosize/](https://mui.com/components/textarea-autosize/)

Extend the package.json file to include your dependencies required. We expect it to be kept minimum - just required to render a React component.
